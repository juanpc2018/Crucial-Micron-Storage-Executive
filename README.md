# Crucial / Micron Storage Executive  </br>

its a Free Software, but nothing is "Free". </br>
IF you have problems running Storage Executive, </br>
is Not because the old Azure Java, </br>
its because the source code is designed to require AVX CPUs </br>
[x86_64-v3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels).[*](https://hackaday.com/2024/02/25/what-is-x86-64-v3/) </br>
does Not run in older CPU´s </br> 
Tested with same Windows8.1x64 SSD on different boards/CPU´s/machines. </br>
if want to upgrade SSD Firmware, requires to do it in a modern machine, </br>
then move SATA SSD to older machine, </br>
similar to Waves Plugin Authorization App, that only works in modern machines, </br>
but allows to activate older plugins in older machines with older installers. </br>

### Mystery Solved. </br>
